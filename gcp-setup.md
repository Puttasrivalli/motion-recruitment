Steps to Create an Azure Account, Set Up a Basic Azure VM, and Deploy a Sample Python Script
Step 1: Create an Azure Account
Sign Up:

Go to the Azure Sign-Up page.
Click on "Start free" to begin the sign-up process.
Enter your email address and create a password, or sign in with an existing Microsoft account.
Verify your email address.
Contact Information:

Provide your contact details, including your name, phone number, and address.
Verify your phone number by entering the verification code sent to your phone.
Payment Information:

Enter your credit card or debit card information for billing purposes. Azure offers a free tier, but billing information is required.
Identity Verification:

Verify your identity by providing your credit card details.
Complete the CAPTCHA and accept the subscription agreement.
Complete Sign-Up:

Review your information and complete the sign-up process. You will be redirected to the Azure Portal.
Step 2: Set Up a Basic Azure VM
Log in to Azure Portal:

Navigate to the Azure Portal and sign in with your Azure account credentials.
Create a Virtual Machine:

In the Azure Portal, search for and select "Virtual machines" from the navigation menu.
Click on "Add" or "Create" to launch a new virtual machine.
Basic Configuration:

Subscription: Choose your subscription.
Resource Group: Create a new resource group or select an existing one.
Virtual Machine Name: Enter a name for your VM (e.g., MyFirstAzureVM).
Region: Choose a region that is closest to you or that suits your deployment needs.
Image: Select an appropriate image for your VM (e.g., "Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS").
Size: Choose a VM size that meets your requirements (e.g., "Standard B1s").
Administrator Account:

Authentication Type: Choose SSH public key for secure access.
Username: Enter a username for the VM administrator.
SSH Public Key: Generate an SSH key pair if you donâ€™t already have one and paste the public key here. Save the private key securely.
Inbound Port Rules:

Allow SSH (port 22) for remote access. You can start with this and add more rules later if needed.
Advanced and Networking Settings:

Review and configure advanced settings as necessary (e.g., disks, networking, management, monitoring, etc.).
For a basic setup, the defaults are typically sufficient.
Review + Create:

Review your VM configurations and click "Create" to deploy the VM.
Wait for the deployment to complete. This may take a few minutes.
Step 3: Deploy a Sample Python Script on the Azure VM
Connect to the Azure VM:

Once the VM is deployed, go to the "Virtual machines" section in the Azure Portal.
Select your newly created VM.
Click on "Connect" and choose "SSH."
Follow the provided SSH command format to use in your terminal to connect to the VM. For example:
ssh -i /path/to/your-private-key.pem username@your-vm-public-ip
Update and Install Dependencies:

Once connected to the VM, update the package lists and install Python:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
Create the Python Script:

Create a new Python script file, for example, add_numbers.py:
nano add_numbers.py
Write a simple Python script inside the file to add two numbers. The script structure can be as follows:
python
Copy Code


# Simple script to add two numbers
a = 10
b = 20
sum = a + b
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum}")
Save and exit the editor (Ctrl + O, Enter to save, and Ctrl + X to exit).
Run the Python Script:

Execute the Python script using Python 3:
python3 add_numbers.py
Verify that the output displays the correct sum of the numbers.
By following these steps, you will create an Azure account, set up a basic Azure VM, and deploy and run a simple Python script that adds two numbers. This approach ensures a thorough understanding of the Azure environment and efficient management of resources.

Step-by-Step Instructions to Create a GCP Account, Set Up a Google Compute Engine Instance, and Deploy a Sample Python Script
Step 1: Create a GCP Account
Sign Up:

Visit the Google Cloud Platform Sign-Up page.
Click on "Get started for free" to begin the sign-up process.
Sign in with your Google account credentials, or create a new account if you don't already have one.
Contact Information:

Provide your contact details, including your name and phone number.
Verify your phone number by entering the verification code sent to your phone.
Payment Information:

Enter your credit card or debit card information for billing purposes. GCP offers a free tier, but billing information is required.
Identity Verification:

Verify your identity by providing your payment details.
Accept the terms of service.
Complete Sign-Up:

Review your information and complete the sign-up process. You will be redirected to the Google Cloud Console.
Step 2: Set Up a Google Compute Engine Instance
Log in to Google Cloud Console:

Navigate to the Google Cloud Console, and sign in with your Google account credentials.
Enable Billing:

Ensure that billing is enabled for your GCP project. You might need to create a new project to proceed.
Create a Compute Engine Instance:

In the Google Cloud Console, use the left-hand navigation menu to select "Compute Engine" and then click on "VM instances."
Click on the "Create instance" button.
Configure Basic Settings:

Name: Enter a name for your VM instance (e.g., my-first-vm).
Region and Zone: Select a region and zone that is closest to you or fits your requirements.
Machine Type: Choose a machine type. The "e2-micro" instance type is part of the free tier and is sufficient for a basic setup.
Boot Disk: Select an appropriate image for your VM. For example, choose "Debian GNU/Linux" or "Ubuntu."
Configure Identity and API Access:

Leave the default options for this basic setup, but review them to understand their purposes.
Firewall Rules:

Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic if you plan to serve web content in the future, otherwise, ensure SSH is allowed for remote access.
Review and Create:

Review your VM configurations and click "Create" to deploy the instance.
Wait for the instance to be provisioned, which may take a few minutes.
Step 3: Deploy a Sample Python Script on the Google Compute Engine Instance
Connect to the Compute Engine Instance:

Once the VM is deployed, go to the "VM instances" section in the Google Cloud Console.
Click the "SSH" button next to your VM instance to open a terminal window connected to your VM.
Update and Install Dependencies:

Once connected to the VM, update the package lists and install Python:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
Create the Python Script:

Create a new Python script file, for example, add_numbers.py:
nano add_numbers.py
Write a simple Python script inside the file to add two numbers. The script structure can be as follows:
python
Copy Code


# Simple script to add two numbers
a = 10
b = 20
sum = a + b
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum}")
Save and exit the editor (Ctrl + O, Enter to save, and Ctrl + X to exit).
Run the Python Script:

Execute the Python script using Python 3:
python3 add_numbers.py
Verify that the output displays the correct sum of the numbers.
By following these steps, you will create a GCP account, set up a Google Compute Engine instance, and deploy and run a simple Python script that adds two numbers. This approach ensures that you efficiently manage and utilize GCP resources while implementing best practices.
